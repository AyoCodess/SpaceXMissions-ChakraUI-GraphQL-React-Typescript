### About

Using the SpaceX GraphQL API, Chakra UI and Typescript, you should create an overview of the past 10 launches.

### Tech Stack

React, Typescript, Chakra UI, Apollo Client.

### Approach

1. Mobile first
2. Simplistic design
3. Modular Code and maintainable code

### Initial Plan

Due to the task time limit being between 24 and 48hrs, I designed as I went along. Chakra UI is a great library!. This was my first time using it and I enjoyed the experience. This task took me 2 working days to complete, 18 hours.

### Core Features

1. Lists past 10, but not limited too, Space X launches.

### Other features

1. If a video, article or shipping details is not available the UI displays alternative state for those sections.

### What could be improved

1. Better overall UX design
2. Typescript types, look at https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/
3. Scroll to accordion item top when clicked automatically, to avoid the user being stuck at bottom when they open a new list item (mobile) \*FIXED

### My Experience

I really enjoyed building this project and focused on modularity and code maintainability, as well as making sure the UI provides a intuitive user experience taking into account time and resources.
